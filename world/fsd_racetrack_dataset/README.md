# FSD Racetrack Dataset

![Alt text](images/dataset_summary.png)
This is an open dataset from StarkStrom Augsburg of various racetrack layouts used in Formula Student Driverless. 
We collected this data during test drives using real sensor data, i.e. LiDAR-sensors. 
Currently it contains 9 tracks with their two boundaries and the SLAM-maps. 

# Data Format

The SLAM-maps are a YAML-list of the 2D-positions of every cone, additionally every cone has an ID.
The boundaries are two YAML-lists of ID's. 

The maps may contain false-positives, the ground-truth boundaries were annotated manually.
The accuracy of the cone positions is 0.2m - 0.3m.
